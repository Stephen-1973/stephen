            <p>
                My carrer started out has a Data Scientist. I first worked in a small startup where I developed my interest towards Web Development. Since I was so interested in Web Development the company that I have worked in helped me in learning web development and soon after that I started creating multiple web front end pages. But my interest didn't stop there I started learning Node Js and Typescript which was new to the Web Industry that time. I worked as Freelancer and did some part time jobs in small companies to gain more experience on Full Stack Web Development.

            <p>
                Finally the big day came when I applied to Amazon as a Full Stack Developer. The excitment didn't last long. After 3 years I quit the job in
                amazon.
                The reason was because when do jobs in companies like FAANG you can either be Backend Developer or Front End or Data Scientist. I wanted to do jobs which involved Data Science as well. I didn't want my skills as Front or Back end or Data Scientist to go to waste.
                So here I am.

                <strong>
                My goal now is to start up a educational company where I teach my students the skills to land a job in FAANG as a Front End Developer or Backend Developer or as a Data Scientist or even how to start up their own company and how to come up incredible ideas and possible fields where they can start up a company in AI world.
